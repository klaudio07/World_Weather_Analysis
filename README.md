# World_Weather_Analysis

# Project Overview

Practice analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip. Successfully completing the tasks will draw on your knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.

# Goal

- Perform tasks using new Python libraries and modules.

- Retrieve and use data from an API "get" request to a server.

- Retrieve and store values from a JSON array.

- Use try and except blocks to resolve errors.

- Write Python functions.

- Create scatter plots using the Matplotlib library, and apply styles and features to a plot.

- Perform linear regression, and add regression lines to scatter plots.

- Create heatmaps, and add markers using the Google Maps API.

# Deliverables

Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap.

Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.

Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
