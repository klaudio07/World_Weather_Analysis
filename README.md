# World_Weather_Analysis

# Project Overview

Practice analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip. Successfully completing the tasks will draw on your knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.

# Goal

- Perform tasks using new Python libraries and modules.

- Retrieve and use data from an API "get" request to a server.

- Retrieve and store values from a JSON array.

- Use try and except blocks to resolve errors.

- Write Python functions.

- Create scatter plots using the Matplotlib library, and apply styles and features to a plot.

- Perform linear regression, and add regression lines to scatter plots.

- Create heatmaps, and add markers using the Google Maps API.
